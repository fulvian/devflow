# DevFlow Branching Strategy v2.0

## MAIN BRANCH: devflow-consolidated-2025-09-19
- **Single source of truth** for all development
- Protected branch with PR requirements  
- All releases tagged from here
- **NO direct commits allowed**

## FEATURE BRANCHES: Linear Stack Pattern (git-spice inspired)
```
devflow-consolidated-2025-09-19
 |
 └── feature/YYYY-MM-DD-component-description
     |
     └── feature/YYYY-MM-DD-dependent-feature (if needed)
```

### Naming Convention
- `feature/YYYY-MM-DD-component-description`
- Examples:
  - `feature/2025-09-19-ccr-enhancement`
  - `feature/2025-09-20-synthetic-integration`
  - `feature/2025-09-21-orchestration-optimization`

### Branch Lifecycle Rules
- **Max lifetime**: 1 week (7 days)
- **Daily sync** with main required via `git rebase`
- **Single component focus** only - no multi-system changes
- **Auto-deletion** after successful merge
- **Emergency hotfix exception**: immediate merge allowed

## EMERGENCY HOTFIX: Direct Path
```
hotfix/YYYY-MM-DD-issue-description
```
- Branch from `devflow-consolidated-2025-09-19`
- Immediate PR required
- Auto-deploy trigger enabled
- Max lifetime: 24 hours

## FORBIDDEN PATTERNS
❌ **Never create these branch types again:**
- `feature/co-me-ta*` (too broad)
- `feature/devflow-v*` (version-based naming)
- `feature/phase-*` (phase-based development)
- `feature/unified-*` (ambiguous scope)
- `backup-*`, `restore-*`, `safety-*` (emergency branches)

## INTEGRATION WORKFLOW
1. **Feature Creation**: `git checkout devflow-consolidated-2025-09-19 && git checkout -b feature/YYYY-MM-DD-description`
2. **Daily Sync**: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/devflow-consolidated-2025-09-19`
3. **Merge**: PR to `devflow-consolidated-2025-09-19` only
4. **Cleanup**: Branch auto-deleted post-merge

This strategy ensures:
✅ Single source of truth
✅ Linear development history  
✅ Reduced merge conflicts
✅ Faster integration cycles
✅ Clear responsibility boundaries
