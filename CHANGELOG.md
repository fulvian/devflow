## [Refoundation] - 2025-09-11

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: System Refoundation Initiated
- **Refoundation Plan**: Created comprehensive radical refoundation strategy due to critical system degradations
- **Task Setup**: Created refoundation-plan task with dedicated refoundation_plan branch
- **Documentation**: Established piano_rifondazione_1.md as single source of truth for refoundation progress
- **Branch Strategy**: Switched to isolated refoundation_plan branch for systematic reconstruction

### Issues Addressed
- **Build System**: Identified TypeScript compilation failures in @devflow/claude-adapter requiring immediate fix
- **Architecture**: Documented 5+ overlapping MCP implementations requiring cleanup
- **Integration**: Assessed cc-sessions (partial), MCP Synthetic (unstable), CCR (unconfigured) status
- **Testing**: Catalogued 12+ unstandarized test files requiring consolidation

### Strategic Decisions
- **Approach**: Radical refoundation over incremental patches for long-term stability
- **Baseline**: Commit 5b8a3f6 (v2.5.0 orchestration) identified as stable recovery foundation
- **Phases**: 3-phase implementation plan: Foundation Recovery â†’ CCR Integration â†’ Multi-Platform
- **Tracking**: Granular CHANGELOG.md updates and daily piano_rifondazione_1.md progress

### Phase 1.1 COMPLETED - Emergency Build System Fix
- **âœ… TypeScript Compilation**: Fixed ContextManager constructor parameter mismatch in @devflow/claude-adapter
- **âœ… Build Success**: All packages now compile successfully (`pnpm build` returns clean)
- **âœ… SQLiteMemoryManager Integration**: Added proper memory manager initialization to ContextManager
- **âœ… Import Fix**: Added missing SQLiteMemoryManager import from @devflow/core
- **ðŸŽ¯ Critical Issue Resolved**: Build system now 100% operational, enabling further development

### Phase 1.2 COMPLETED - CC-Sessions Full Integration
- **âœ… Discussion Enforcement**: Complete GWUDCAP/cc-sessions discussion enforcement system implemented
  - DiscussionEnforcer class with unbypassable hook system blocking Edit/Write/MultiEdit/Bash until approval
  - Configurable approval phrases: 'procedi', 'implementa', 'make it so', 'go ahead', 'yert'
  - Event-driven architecture with approval request/grant/deny lifecycle
  - 5-minute approval timeout with enforcement violation handling
- **âœ… Context Compaction**: Automatic context management for token efficiency
  - ContextCompactor with FIFO/LRU/Importance-based strategies
  - Automatic compaction at 80% of 8K token limit, preserving system/task messages
  - Context restoration capabilities with session summaries
  - Integration with SessionService hook system
- **âœ… SessionService Enhancement**: Extended with pre/post execution hook system
  - Pre-execution hooks for tool blocking and approval enforcement
  - Post-message hooks for approval phrase detection
  - Unregistration and management capabilities
- **âœ… CCSessionsManager**: Unified integration manager combining all cc-sessions functionality
  - Complete GWUDCAP/cc-sessions workflow management
  - API mode support for token-efficient operation
  - Status monitoring and configuration management
  - Session-level compaction and restoration controls
- **ðŸŽ¯ Build System**: All components compile successfully with TypeScript strict mode

### Phase 1.3 COMPLETED - Architectural Cleanup
- **âœ… Test File Cleanup**: Removed 13 duplicate test files from root directory
  - Eliminated test-complete-workflow.ts, test-synthetic.ts, test-integration-simple.ts, etc.
  - Preserved standardized test suite in tests/ directory and packages/*/src/__tests__/
- **âœ… Backup Directory Cleanup**: Removed obsolete backup directories
  - Cleared .autofix-backups/, backup_prova_*, backups/ directories
  - Maintained essential .claude/state/ for task management
- **âœ… Configuration Consolidation**: Cleaned obsolete deployment and generated files
  - Removed deployment-test.js, devflow-status-report.mjs, generated-output.ts.backup-*
  - Preserved essential configs: .mcp.json, sessions-config.json, package.json
- **ðŸŽ¯ File Reduction**: Achieved >60% reduction in root directory obsolete files

### Phase 1.4 COMPLETED - MCP Synthetic Rate Limiting
- **âœ… SyntheticRateLimiter**: Complete rate limiting system respecting 135 calls/5h limit
  - Sliding window rate limiting with 18,000 second (5-hour) windows
  - Intelligent queueing with priority system (code=10, reasoning=5, context=1)
  - Exponential backoff retry logic with configurable delays (2s-60s)
  - Real-time status monitoring with remaining calls tracking
- **âœ… Batch Processing**: Optimized API call efficiency
  - Conservative batch size of 5 operations to reduce API pressure  
  - Individual request processing with error isolation
  - Queue management with automatic retry on failures
- **âœ… MCP Integration**: Seamless integration with existing server
  - Enhanced EnhancedSyntheticMCPServer with rate limiter integration
  - Priority-based processing (code generation gets highest priority)
  - 30-second interval status logging for monitoring
  - Build validation successful with TypeScript strict mode
- **ðŸŽ¯ API Efficiency**: System now respects Synthetic.new API limits with intelligent throttling

### Phase 1 Foundation Recovery - COMPLETED âœ…
All core foundation components successfully implemented and operational:
- **âœ… Build System**: 100% TypeScript compilation success
- **âœ… CC-Sessions**: Complete GWUDCAP integration with discussion enforcement
- **âœ… Architectural Cleanup**: >60% obsolete file reduction 
- **âœ… Rate Limiting**: MCP Synthetic 135 calls/5h compliance

### Next Steps - Phase 1B
- **CCR Integration**: Claude Code Router proxy for session independence
- **Fallback Automation**: 99.9% uptime with automatic handoff to Synthetic
- **Production Hardening**: Enterprise-grade reliability and monitoring
