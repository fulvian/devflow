## [Refoundation] - 2025-09-11

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: System Refoundation Initiated
- **Refoundation Plan**: Created comprehensive radical refoundation strategy due to critical system degradations
- **Task Setup**: Created refoundation-plan task with dedicated refoundation_plan branch

### Strategic Decisions
- **Approach**: Radical refoundation over incremental patches for long-term stability
- **Baseline**: Commit 5b8a3f6 (v2.5.0 orchestration) identified as stable recovery foundation
- **Phases**: 3-phase implementation plan: Foundation Recovery â†’ CCR Integration â†’ Multi-Platform
- **Tracking**: Granular CHANGELOG.md updates and daily piano_rifondazione_1.md progress
