## Database Architecture - CRITICAL

### ‚úÖ CURRENT DATABASE (Use This ONLY)
- **Database**: `./data/devflow_unified.sqlite`
- **Environment**: `DEVFLOW_DB_PATH=./data/devflow_unified.sqlite`
- **Migration Completed**: 2025-09-22
- **Records Migrated**: 161 total records from 3 legacy databases

### ‚ùå DEPRECATED DATABASES (Do NOT Use - BLOCKED)
- `./devflow.sqlite.DEPRECATED` - Migrated to unified DB
- `./data/devflow.sqlite.DEPRECATED` - Migrated to unified DB
- `./data/vector.sqlite.DEPRECATED` - Migrated to unified DB

### üîí ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
1. **Pre-commit Hook**: `.claude/hooks/pre-commit-legacy-db-check.sh` - BLOCKS commits with legacy DB references
2. **Validation Script**: `scripts/validate_no_legacy_db.sh` - Detects legacy references in codebase
3. **Deprecation Markers**: `*.DEPRECATED.txt` files - Clear warning documentation
4. **Environment Protection**: All services configured for unified database only

### üìä UNIFIED DATABASE BENEFITS
- **Single Source of Truth**: No database fragmentation
- **Context7 Compliant**: Data organized in `data/` folder
- **Referential Integrity**: Full foreign key enforcement
- **Performance Optimized**: Strategic indexes and audit triggers
- **Vector Integration**: Unified embeddings with project contexts

**ANY CODE REFERENCING DEPRECATED DATABASES WILL BE BLOCKED AT COMMIT**

For rollback information: `./backups/20250922_010603/`

## Collaboration Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Transparency First**: All interactions must be fully documented and accessible to authorized stakeholders
2. **Synthetic Augmentation**: Human-AI collaboration must leverage AI capabilities to enhance human creativity
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through structured feedback loops
4. **Context Preservation**: Complete historical context must be maintained for all development activities
5. **Autonomous Compliance**: Systems must self-enforce protocols without external oversight

### Collaboration Requirements
- All communication must occur through designated channels with automatic logging
- Context switching must be explicitly documented with state preservation
- Knowledge transfer must be bidirectional between human and AI participants
- Decision-making processes must be traceable to specific inputs and reasoning paths
- All stakeholders must acknowledge and accept these principles before engagement

---

## Task Management Framework

### Hierarchical Task Structure
1. **Projects** (Highest level strategic initiatives)
2. **Plans** (Multi-phase execution strategies)
3. **Roadmaps** (Timeline-based implementation sequences)
4. **Macrotasks** (Major functional components)
5. **Microtasks** (Atomic development units)
6. **Sessions** (Time-bound work periods)

### Task Lifecycle Management
- All tasks must progress through defined states: CREATED ‚Üí ASSIGNED ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí REVIEW ‚Üí COMPLETED
- State transitions must be explicitly triggered with justification documentation
- Task dependencies must be declared and validated before execution
- Resource allocation must be automatically optimized based on capability matching
- Completion criteria must be measurable and verifiable through automated means

### Task Assignment Protocols
- Synthetic delegation is mandatory for all coding activities
- Human participants may only provide specifications, not direct implementation
- Task ownership must be clearly assigned with accountability tracking
- Cross-task dependencies must be resolved through automated coordination
- Task prioritization must align with project-level strategic objectives

---

## Synthetic Delegation Protocol

### Mandatory Delegation Requirements
1. **All coding activities must be synthetically delegated**
2. **Human participants may only specify requirements, not implementation details**
3. **AI agents must generate complete solutions with verification mechanisms**
4. **All delegated tasks must include self-validation components**
5. **Human review is limited to specification verification, not code inspection**

### Delegation Process

The delegation process defines how tasks are assigned and tracked within the CLAUDE system. All delegation must follow these strict procedures:

1. **Task Assignment Hierarchy**:
   - All microtasks must be assigned through the central delegation engine
   - Manual task assignment is prohibited and will trigger immediate penalties
   - Each microtask must have a single responsible agent with clear completion criteria
   - Task dependencies must be explicitly declared in the task metadata

2. **Delegation Validation**:
   - All delegations are validated against the project roadmap before execution
   - Invalid delegations (conflicting priorities, missing dependencies) are automatically rejected
   - Delegation chains must not exceed 5 levels to prevent accountability diffusion
   - Cross-project delegations require explicit approval from both project leads

3. **Delegation Tracking**:
   - All delegations are logged with timestamp, delegator, delegatee, and task context
   - Delegation modifications require cryptographic signatures from both parties
   - Failed delegation acceptance triggers automatic reassignment to backup agents
   - Delegation completion must be confirmed through the verification system

---

## MCP Integration Standards

### Required MCP Tool Usage
1. **MANDATORY Synthetic Delegation**: ALL coding tasks MUST use `mcp__devflow-synthetic-cc-sessions__synthetic_*` tools
2. **NO DIRECT CODING**: Human participants may NEVER write code directly - only via Synthetic agents
3. **Task ID Standard**: Format DEVFLOW-[COMPONENT]-[SEQUENCE] (e.g., DEVFLOW-AUTH-001)
4. **Tool Selection Priority**: synthetic_code ‚Üí synthetic_reasoning ‚Üí synthetic_context ‚Üí synthetic_auto
5. **Verification Required**: All Synthetic outputs must pass continuous verification before integration

### Anti-Circumvention for MCP
- Using Task tool to bypass line limits is PROHIBITED
- Manual file creation to avoid delegation is PROHIBITED
- Splitting large files to circumvent enforcement is PROHIBITED
- All violations trigger immediate escalation to Level 2 penalties

---

## Enforcement Rules

### 100-Line Limit Enforcement (MANDATORY)
1. **Hard Limit**: No file may exceed 100 lines - NO EXCEPTIONS without MCP approval
2. **Anti-Splitting**: Files artificially split to bypass limits trigger automatic consolidation

4. **Enforcement Tools**: Pre-commit hooks BLOCK violations immediately
5. **Penalties**: Violations result in automatic commit rejection + Level 1 penalty

### Synthetic Delegation Enforcement (MANDATORY)
1. **ALL CODING TASKS**: Must be delegated to Synthetic agents via MCP tools
2. **NO MANUAL CODING**: Direct code writing by humans is PROHIBITED
3. **Task Tool Restrictions**: Using Task tool for coding bypasses is PROHIBITED
4. **Verification Required**: All Synthetic code must pass meta-verification
5. **Enforcement**: Violations trigger immediate access suspension

### Database Management Enforcement (MANDATORY)
1. **Automatic Tracking**: All projects-plans-roadmaps-macrotasks-microtasks-sessions MUST be auto-logged
2. **State Persistence**: Task state changes MUST update database immediately
3. **Audit Trails**: All database changes MUST have immutable audit logs

## Verification Mechanisms

### Continuous Verification (MANDATORY)

## Important Instruction Reminders

### Non-Negotiable Requirements
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving goals
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- ALWAYS use Synthetic delegation for ALL coding tasks - NO EXCEPTIONS

### Final Authority
This CLAUDE.md file represents the FINAL AUTHORITY on all development processes, enforcement rules, and compliance requirements for the DevFlow project. All participants must acknowledge and adhere to these rules without exception.
