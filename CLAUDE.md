# Zero Touch Architecture (ZTA)

## Overview
The Zero Touch Architecture is a four-level enforcement system designed to prevent the Architect from directly writing or modifying code while maintaining full orchestration capabilities.

## Four-Level Enforcement System

### Level 1: Hook Pre-Tool Totale
- **Purpose**: Complete tool access control
- **Allowed Tools**: Read, Glob, Grep, mcp__*, Task, TodoWrite, WebFetch, WebSearch
- **Blocked Tools**: Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookEdit, and all modification tools
- **Allowed Bash**: ls, find, cat, wc, head, tail, git status, git log, git branch

### Level 2: Command Pattern Blocking
- **Purpose**: Prevent filesystem modifications
- **Blocked Patterns**: mv, rm, cp, mkdir, touch, echo >, >>, sed, awk, chmod, chown
- **Allowed Operations**: Inspection-only commands

### Level 3: Delegation Enforcement
- **Purpose**: Mandatory delegation for code tasks
- **Triggers**: implement, write, modify, create, update, delete, function, class, method, component
- **Action**: Automatic routing to synthetic agents

### Level 4: Context Awareness
- **Purpose**: Intent recognition from prompts
- **Detection**: Code writing patterns in context
- **Response**: Force delegation when detected
- **Cooling Period**: 5-second delay before tool execution

## Implementation
The system is implemented in `enforce-delegation.py` which provides:
1. Pre-command analysis
2. Intent recognition
3. Multi-level enforcement
4. Delegation routing

## Whitelist of Allowed Operations
- Read-only file operations (Read, Glob, Grep)
- Information retrieval (WebFetch, WebSearch)
- Task management (Task, TodoWrite)
- Read-only Bash commands (ls, find, cat, wc, head, tail)
- Git inspection (git status, git log, git branch)

## Synthetic Agent Routing
When delegation is required:
1. Task is analyzed for implementation requirements
2. Appropriate synthetic agent is selected
3. Task is routed with full context
4. Execution is monitored for compliance

## Compliance Monitoring
All commands pass through the four-level enforcement system before execution, ensuring zero tolerance policy for direct implementation by the Architect.
