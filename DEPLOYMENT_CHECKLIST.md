# Orchestration System Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment

### Code & Repository
- [ ] All feature branches merged to main
- [ ] Code review completed for all changes
- [ ] All automated tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Security scan completed with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Release tag created in Git

### Environment Preparation
- [ ] Production environment backup completed
- [ ] Database migration scripts tested in staging
- [ ] Configuration values verified for production
- [ ] SSL certificates validated and updated if needed
- [ ] External service connections tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

### Communication
- [ ] Deployment announcement sent to stakeholders
- [ ] Support team briefed on changes
- [ ] Customer-impacting changes documented
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled and communicated

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Preparation
- [ ] Freeze code changes in main branch
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment for final validation
- [ ] Execute database migration in staging
- [ ] Validate staging deployment functionality
- [ ] Confirm monitoring and alerting systems active

### Phase 2: Production Deployment
- [ ] Begin deployment at scheduled maintenance window
- [ ] Deploy orchestration system to canary environment
- [ ] Monitor canary deployment for 30 minutes
- [ ] Deploy to production cluster (50% capacity)
- [ ] Validate core functionality with production data
- [ ] Deploy to remaining production capacity
- [ ] Execute database migration in production
- [ ] Update DNS/load balancer configurations

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Execute post-deployment verification script
- [ ] Validate all API endpoints
- [ ] Confirm task processing functionality
- [ ] Verify monitoring and alerting systems
- [ ] Check system performance metrics
- [ ] Validate external service integrations

## Post-Deployment

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Monitor system for 2 hours post-deployment
- [ ] Validate backup systems are functioning
- [ ] Update system documentation
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of deployment completion

### Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Review deployment process and update checklist
- [ ] Analyze performance metrics against baseline
- [ ] Address any post-deployment issues
- [ ] Update knowledge base with deployment learnings

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are discovered:
1. Immediately notify deployment team and stakeholders
2. Revert DNS/load balancer to previous version
3. Restore database from pre-deployment backup
4. Monitor system stability
5. Document rollback reasons and impacts
