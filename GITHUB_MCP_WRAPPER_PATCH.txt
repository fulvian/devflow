Patch for scripts/github-mcp-wrapper.sh:

The current script has an issue with how the CONTAINER_ID is being assigned. The docker run command with the -i flag for stdio integration should not capture the container ID in a variable because it will block the stdio communication.

Replace this section:

main() {
    check_requirements

    # Pull latest image silently
    docker pull "$IMAGE" &> /dev/null

    # Generate unique container name for this session
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s%3N)
    CONTAINER_NAME="${CONTAINER_NAME_PREFIX}-${TIMESTAMP}"

    # Run container with stdio and pass through all arguments
    CONTAINER_ID=$(docker run --rm -i \
        --name "$CONTAINER_NAME" \
        -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="$GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
        "$IMAGE" "$@")
}

With this corrected version:

main() {
    check_requirements

    # Pull latest image silently
    docker pull "$IMAGE" &> /dev/null

    # Run container with stdio and pass through all arguments
    # Note: We don't capture CONTAINER_ID because -i flag requires direct stdio connection
    docker run --rm -i \
        -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="$GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
        "$IMAGE" "$@"
}
