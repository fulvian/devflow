## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Intent Tracking System ✅
- **Capture Original Requests**: Parses user requirements from conversation history
- **Structured Requirements**: Converts natural language to structured ParsedRequirement objects
- **Context Enrichment**: Adds technical context (branch, codebase state, recent changes)
- **Priority Assessment**: Automatically assesses priority (low/medium/high/critical)
- **Complexity Analysis**: Determines complexity (simple/moderate/complex/enterprise)
- **Dependency Extraction**: Identifies dependencies between requirements

### 2. Outcome Validation Engine ✅
- **Implementation Evidence Gathering**: Collects code changes, file modifications, tests, deployments
- **Requirement Matching**: Validates each requirement against actual implementation
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing implementations, incorrect behavior, deployment failures
- **Scoring System**: Provides 0-100 adherence scores with detailed breakdown
- **Validation Methods**: Supports code analysis, behavior tests, deployment checks, user confirmation

### 3. Deployment Verification ✅  
- **Specification Extraction**: Derives deployment requirements from user intent
- **Health Check Validation**: Verifies deployment health and accessibility
- **Environment Compliance**: Ensures deployment matches requested environment
- **Endpoint Verification**: Validates expected endpoints are accessible
- **Gap Reporting**: Detailed reporting of deployment adherence gaps

### 4. Real-time Validation ✅
- **Implementation Monitoring**: Tracks implementation progress in real-time
- **Early Warning System**: Alerts when implementation diverges from requirements
- **Continuous Feedback**: Provides feedback during development process
- **Stop/Continue Recommendations**: Suggests when to halt implementation due to poor adherence

### 5. Integration with Existing Systems ✅
- **Continuous Verification Loop**: Integrates with existing continuous-verification-loop.ts
- **Plan Adherence Validator**: Works with existing plan-adherence-validator.ts
- **Task System**: Integrates with task hierarchy and current task tracking
- **Memory System**: Leverages conversation history and context

## Technical Architecture

### Core Classes
- **UserRequirementAdherenceVerifier**: Main verification engine
- **UserRequirementIntegration**: Integration wrapper and orchestrator
- **Comprehensive Interfaces**: 15+ TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### Key Interfaces
- `UserIntent`: Captures user requirements and context
- `ParsedRequirement`: Structured requirement representation  
- `OutcomeValidation`: Validation results with scoring and gaps
- `ImplementationEvidence`: Evidence of actual implementation
- `DeploymentVerificationResult`: Deployment adherence results
- `AdherenceGap`: Detailed gap analysis with severity and recommendations

### Data Flow
1. **Intent Capture**: User request → Parsed requirements → Enriched context
2. **Evidence Gathering**: Code changes → File modifications → Test results → Deployment data
3. **Validation Engine**: Requirements vs. Evidence → Gap analysis → Scoring
4. **Reporting**: Comprehensive adherence reports with recommendations

### Persistence
- `.claude/state/user_intents.json` - Stored user intents
- `.claude/state/outcome_validations.json` - Validation results  
- `.claude/state/conversation_history.json` - Conversation context

## Key Capabilities

- File system monitoring for modifications
- Test framework integration for behavior verification
- Deployment log parsing for deployment evidence

### Advanced Validation Methods
