## Overview

The Project Lifecycle Management (PLM) system is an automated project management platform that organizes work through a hierarchical structure:

- **Projects** (Top-level initiatives)
- **Plans** (Strategic blueprints)
- **Roadmaps** (Timeline-based planning)
- **MacroTasks** (Major work packages)
- **MicroTasks** (Atomic work units)

Integrated with DevFlow Cometa, Claude Code hooks, and SQLite database, the system provides natural language processing capabilities for project management operations.
