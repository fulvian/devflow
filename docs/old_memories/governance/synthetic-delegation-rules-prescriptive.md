# Synthetic Delegation Rules (DEVFLOW-RULES-001)

## Overview
This document establishes mandatory synthetic delegation rules for the DevFlow system. These rules enforce that all development activities must be performed through designated synthetic agents rather than direct human code creation.

## Rule Categories

### MANDATORY Delegation Rules
Rules that **MUST** be enforced with automated blocking mechanisms.

#### MDR-001: Direct Code Writing Prevention
**Trigger Condition:** Any attempt to write code directly in production environments or version control systems
**Enforcement Mechanism:**
- Git pre-commit hooks blocking direct commits to protected branches
- IDE plugins preventing save operations to monitored directories
- CI/CD pipeline rejection of non-delegated code changes
**Context-Aware Application (DAIC Mode):**
- Applies to all production, staging, and shared development environments
- Exempts emergency hotfix procedures (requires post-facto audit approval)

#### MDR-002: Synthetic Agent Authentication
**Trigger Condition:** Code submission without valid synthetic agent signature
**Enforcement Mechanism:**
- Automated verification of synthetic agent cryptographic signatures
- Rejection of unsigned or improperly signed code submissions
- Mandatory synthetic agent identity validation in CI/CD pipeline
**Context-Aware Application (DAIC Mode):**
- All code changes must include agent metadata with provenance tracking
- Emergency bypass requires manager override with audit trail

#### MDR-003: Workflow Integration Compliance
**Trigger Condition:** Development activity outside approved synthetic delegation workflow
**Enforcement Mechanism:**
- API gateway blocking direct system access
- Activity monitoring agents detecting unauthorized development patterns
- Automated rollback of non-compliant changes
**Context-Aware Application (DAIC Mode):**
- Applies to all development, testing, and deployment activities
- Integration testing environments exempt with explicit project lead approval

### OPTIONAL Delegation Guidelines
Rules that are recommended but not automatically enforced.

#### ODR-001: Agent Selection Optimization
**Trigger Condition:** Available when multiple synthetic agents can handle a task
**Enforcement Mechanism:**
- Agent recommendation engine suggestions
- Performance metrics tracking for agent selection
- Periodic optimization reports
**Context-Aware Application (DAIC Mode):**
- Recommendations based on task complexity and agent specialization
- Historical performance data influences agent selection

#### ODR-002: Collaboration Pattern Enhancement
**Trigger Condition:** Multi-agent development scenarios
**Enforcement Mechanism:**
- Coordination protocol suggestions
- Conflict detection and resolution recommendations
- Communication pathway optimization
**Context-Aware Application (DAIC Mode):**
- Dynamic adjustment based on project complexity and team structure

## Conflict Resolution Hierarchy

### Level 1: Automated Resolution
- Rule conflicts resolved by precedence order (MDR > ODR)
- Timestamp-based resolution for same-rule conflicts
- System-default behavior for undefined scenarios

### Level 2: Manager Override
- Requires authenticated managerial approval
- Mandatory justification documentation
- Automatic audit trail generation

### Level 3: Governance Board Review
- Escalation for systemic or repeated conflicts
- Requires formal review process
- Policy update recommendations

## Tool-Level Validation

### Pre-Execution Validation
```yaml
validation_rules:
  - agent_authentication: required
  - workflow_compliance: mandatory
  - environment_context: verified
  - signature_integrity: validated
```

### Runtime Monitoring
```yaml
monitoring_agents:
  - activity_tracker: continuous
  - compliance_auditor: real-time
  - performance_analyzer: periodic
  - security_scanner: pre-deployment
```

### Post-Execution Verification
```yaml
verification_process:
  - result_validation: automated
  - audit_trail_generation: mandatory
  - performance_benchmarking: continuous
  - compliance_reporting: daily
```

## Audit Trail Specifications

### Required Audit Elements
1. **Agent Identity**: Cryptographic signature and metadata
2. **Task Description**: Detailed activity log with parameters
3. **Execution Context**: Environment, time, and purpose
4. **Result Verification**: Success/failure status with metrics
5. **Human Intervention**: Any manual overrides with justification

### Audit Storage Requirements
- Immutable log storage with cryptographic hashing
- Minimum 7-year retention for production changes
- Real-time backup to centralized audit system
- Access logging for audit trail queries

### Compliance Reporting
- Daily compliance status reports
- Weekly detailed audit summaries
- Monthly governance board presentations
- Annual compliance certification process

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Workflow Mapping
| Traditional Activity | Synthetic Delegation Equivalent | Integration Point |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Manual coding | Agent-assisted development | IDE integration |
| Code review | Automated compliance checking | CI/CD pipeline |
| Testing | Synthetic test agent execution | Test automation |
| Deployment | Agent-mediated deployment | Deployment pipeline |

### Transition Requirements
1. **Phase 1**: Parallel execution with shadow auditing
2. **Phase 2**: Gradual enforcement activation
3. **Phase 3**: Full mandatory compliance
4. **Phase 4**: Continuous optimization

## Enforcement Implementation Matrix

| Rule ID | Enforcement Mechanism | Monitoring Tool | Escalation Path |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| MDR-001 | Git hooks + IDE plugins | Activity tracker | Manager override |
| MDR-002 | CI/CD signature validation | Compliance auditor | Governance board |
| MDR-003 | API gateway + rollback | Security scanner | Emergency protocol |
| ODR-001 | Recommendation engine | Performance analyzer | Optimization report |
| ODR-002 | Coordination protocol | Communication monitor | Team lead review |

## Violation Response Protocol

### Immediate Actions
1. Activity blocking with user notification
2. Violation logging with severity classification
3. Stakeholder notification based on impact level

### Corrective Measures
1. Mandatory re-delegation through proper channels
2. Additional training for repeat violations
3. Temporary access restriction for severe violations

### Escalation Triggers
- 3 violations in 30 days: Manager review required
- 5 violations in 90 days: Governance board escalation
- Security impact: Immediate suspension and investigation

## Version Control
- Document Version: 1.0
- Effective Date: [Implementation Date]
- Review Cycle: Quarterly
- Approval Authority: DevFlow Governance Board
