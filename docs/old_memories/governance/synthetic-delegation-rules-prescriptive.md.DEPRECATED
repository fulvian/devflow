# ⚠️ DEPRECATED PROTOCOL - DO NOT USE

**Original File**: synthetic-delegation-rules-prescriptive.md
**Deprecation Date**: 2025-09-24
**Removal Scheduled**: 2025-10-01
**Superseded By**: /CLAUDE.md Section "MCP Integration Standards (UPDATED 2025-09-24)"

## Deprecation Reason

This protocol used **DAIC mode** and prescriptive delegation patterns that have been replaced by the **Unified Orchestrator architecture**. The enforcement mechanisms described here are incompatible with the new system.

## Migration Path

All functionality from this file has been consolidated into:

1. **Primary Protocol**: `/CLAUDE.md` - Section "MCP Integration Standards"
2. **Architecture**: `/docs/architettura/architettura_orchestrazione_agenti_1.md`
3. **Implementation**: `/.claude/hooks/unified-orchestrator-bridge.py`
4. **Registry**: `/config/protocol-registry.json`

## Breaking Changes

- **DAIC mode**: Removed - replaced by operational modes (all-mode, claude-only, cli-only, synthetic-only)
- **Direct blocking**: Replaced by orchestrator routing with fail-open design
- **Prescriptive rules**: Replaced by intelligent routing based on task complexity and security

## Do Not Reference This File

Any code, hooks, or documentation referencing this file should be updated to use the new protocol structure defined in the Master Protocol Registry.
