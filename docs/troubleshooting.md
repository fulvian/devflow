# Orchestration System Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
This guide provides solutions for common issues encountered when using the Orchestration System.

## Common Issues

### 1. Workflow Execution Failures

**Symptom**: Workflows fail to execute or get stuck in "running" state.

**Possible Causes and Solutions**:

#### Database Connection Issues
Check database connectivity:
```bash
# Test database connection
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;"
```

Verify database credentials in environment variables.

#### Resource Exhaustion
Check system resources:
```bash
# Check CPU and memory usage
top

# Check disk space
df -h
```

Scale up resources or optimize workflow tasks to use fewer resources.

#### Task Dependencies
Verify task dependencies are correctly defined:
```javascript
// Incorrect - circular dependency
{
  tasks: [
    { name: 'A', dependsOn: ['B'] },
    { name: 'B', dependsOn: ['A'] }
  ]
}

// Correct
{
  tasks: [
    { name: 'A' },
    { name: 'B', dependsOn: ['A'] }
  ]
}
```

### 2. API Authentication Errors

**Symptom**: `401 Unauthorized` responses from API endpoints.

**Solution**:
1. Verify API key is correctly set in `Authorization` header
2. Check API key has not expired
3. Ensure no extra spaces in the header value:
   ```
   # Correct
   Authorization: Bearer sk_1234567890abcdef
   
   # Incorrect
   Authorization: Bearer  sk_1234567890abcdef
   ```

### 3. Scheduling Issues

**Symptom**: Scheduled workflows not executing at expected times.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify cron expression syntax using online validators
2. Check system timezone configuration matches intended schedule timezone
3. Ensure scheduler service is running:
   ```bash
   # Check scheduler status
   curl https://api.orchestration-system.com/v1/health/scheduler
   ```

### 4. Performance Degradation

**Symptom**: Slow API responses or delayed workflow execution.

**Solutions**:
1. Check database performance:
   ```sql
   -- Check for slow queries
   SELECT query, mean_time FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_time DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
2. Monitor Redis performance:
   ```bash
   redis-cli --stat
   ```
3. Scale system resources based on load
4. Optimize complex workflows by breaking into smaller workflows

## Diagnostic Commands

### Check System Health
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.orchestration-system.com/v1/health
```

### List Recent Failed Executions
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.orchestration-system.com/v1/executions?status=failed&limit=10"
```

### Get Detailed Execution Information
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.orchestration-system.com/v1/executions/{executionId}
```

## Log Analysis

### Log Levels
- `error`: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- `warn`: Potential problems that should be investigated
- `info`: General operational information
- `debug`: Detailed information for troubleshooting

### Common Log Patterns

#### Task Execution Errors
```
ERROR [TaskExecutor] Task 'data-transform-123' failed: Connection timeout
```
Solution: Check network connectivity to task execution environment

#### Database Connection Issues
```
ERROR [Database] Connection pool exhausted
```
Solution: Increase database connection pool size or optimize queries

#### Resource Warnings
```
WARN [Scheduler] High memory usage detected: 85%
```
Solution: Scale system resources or optimize workflow definitions
