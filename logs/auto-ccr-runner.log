(node:58349) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/fulvioventura/devflow/tools/auto-ccr-runner.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/fulvioventura/devflow/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
