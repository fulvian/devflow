// ⚠️ DEPRECATED JAVASCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION - DO NOT USE

/*
Original File: synthetic-delegation-rules.js
Deprecation Date: 2025-09-24
Removal Scheduled: 2025-10-01
Superseded By: /.claude/hooks/unified-orchestrator-bridge.py

DEPRECATION REASON:
This JavaScript implementation used MDR (Mandatory Delegation Rules) pattern
with DAIC mode checking, which has been replaced by the Unified Orchestrator
architecture with Python-based hook integration.

MIGRATION PATH:
All validation logic has been consolidated into:
1. Primary Hook: /.claude/hooks/unified-orchestrator-bridge.py
2. Configuration: /config/protocol-registry.json
3. Enforcement: /CLAUDE.md "MCP Integration Standards"

BREAKING CHANGES:
- MDR-001, MDR-002, MDR-003: Replaced by orchestrator routing
- DAIC mode checking: Replaced by operational mode system
- JavaScript hooks: Migrated to Python for better database integration
- Direct validation: Replaced by fail-open orchestrator pattern

DO NOT REFERENCE THIS FILE:
Any hooks or systems importing this file should be updated to use
the new unified-orchestrator-bridge.py implementation.

For current implementation, see:
- Hook: /.claude/hooks/unified-orchestrator-bridge.py
- Registry: /config/protocol-registry.json
- Documentation: /CLAUDE.md
