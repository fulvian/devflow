## Context Manifest

### How DevFlow Cognitive Task+Memory System Phase 1 Currently Works

The DevFlow system represents a sophisticated multi-layer architecture designed to coordinate AI agents (Claude Code, Synthetic API, OpenAI Codex, etc.) with persistent memory, semantic search capabilities, and intelligent task management. The system operates through four interconnected core services that work together to provide context-aware task execution with cross-session memory persistence.

**Architecture Overview:**
The system is built around a central DevFlow Orchestrator that manages four primary components: TaskHierarchyService (SQLite-based task management), SemanticMemoryService (vector embeddings and similarity search), MemoryBridgeService (context injection/harvesting protocols), and SyntheticApiClient (rate-limited API integration). Each service operates independently but communicates through well-defined interfaces to provide a cohesive cognitive memory system.

**Task Hierarchy Management Flow:**
When a task is created through the TaskHierarchyService, it gets stored in the SQLite `task_contexts` table with a comprehensive schema that includes priority levels (h-, m-, l-, ?-), status tracking (planning, active, blocked, completed, archived), platform routing intelligence, and specialized context objects for different AI platforms. The service supports full hierarchical relationships with parent-child task dependencies, temporal consistency validation, and transactional operations. Each task context includes architectural_context, implementation_context, debugging_context, and maintenance_context JSON fields that are optimized for specific AI platforms.

The database schema is production-ready with foreign key constraints, indexes for performance optimization, and automatic timestamp maintenance through triggers. The system uses SQLite with WAL mode, 64MB cache, and memory-based temporary storage for optimal performance. Task creation generates unique IDs using SQLite's randomblob function, and all operations support proper error handling with custom exception types (TaskNotFoundError, TaskHierarchyError, DatabaseError).

**Semantic Memory and Vector Embeddings:**
The SemanticMemoryService integrates vector embeddings through a pluggable model system. When tasks are processed, their content (title, description, status, priority) is extracted and sent to embedding models for vector generation. The current implementation includes a MockEmbeddingModel for testing (384-dimensional vectors with consistent pseudo-random generation) and a production SyntheticEmbeddingModel that interfaces with the Synthetic API.

Embeddings are stored in the `memory_block_embeddings` table as binary BLOBs using efficient float32 serialization. The service provides similarity search through cosine similarity calculations, batch embedding generation with configurable batch sizes, and automatic synchronization with the task hierarchy. When tasks are deleted or modified, the semantic memory automatically cleans up orphaned embeddings and regenerates vectors as needed.

**Memory Bridge Protocol System:**
The MemoryBridgeService implements sophisticated context injection and harvesting protocols designed to work within strict token budget constraints (default 2000 tokens). When an AI agent needs context for a task, the service retrieves the task details and finds semantically similar tasks using the vector database. It calculates token usage using a 4-characters-per-token estimation and applies compression when approaching the 1800-token threshold.

Context injection creates AgentContext objects that include the primary task, similar tasks with similarity scores, token usage breakdowns, and optional compressed context strings. The service maintains a budget tracking system that prevents token budget overruns and provides detailed status information about active contexts and remaining capacity. After agent execution, the harvesting protocol reclaims tokens and stores execution results for future reference.

**Synthetic API Integration and Rate Limiting:**
The SyntheticApiClient provides production-ready API integration with comprehensive authentication (OAuth2 client credentials flow), retry logic with exponential backoff, and sophisticated rate limiting. The client maintains token refresh automatically, handles various error conditions (401, 429, 500-level errors), and provides batch request optimization through a BatchProcessor that groups requests within 50ms windows.

The rate limiting system operates on a sliding window basis with configurable limits (default 135 requests per 5-hour window for compliance). The client includes request queuing, concurrent batch processing, and detailed logging for debugging and monitoring. All API calls include proper timeout handling, request ID tracking for traceability, and comprehensive error categorization.

**Database Schema and Production Features:**
The complete database schema includes tables for task_contexts, memory_blocks, coordination_sessions, platform_performance, cost_analytics, knowledge_entities, and entity_relationships. The schema supports full-text search through FTS5 virtual tables, automatic trigger-based maintenance, and comprehensive indexing for query performance.

Production features include schema versioning, automatic timestamp updates, access count tracking for memory blocks, and platform performance analytics. The system tracks cost analytics, user satisfaction metrics, cross-platform handoff success rates, and maintains knowledge entities for long-term learning from development patterns.

**Cross-Session Persistence and Memory Reconstruction:**
The system maintains persistent state across sessions through the SQLite database and memory block storage. When a new session begins, the TaskHierarchyService can reconstruct the complete task hierarchy, the SemanticMemoryService can rebuild vector indexes from stored embeddings, and the MemoryBridgeService can restore budget tracking and active context information.

Memory reconstruction involves loading task contexts from the database, verifying embedding synchronization, and rebuilding in-memory caches for optimal performance. The system maintains temporal consistency through timestamp tracking and provides comprehensive audit trails for debugging and compliance.

### For Real-World Testing Implementation: What Needs Integration and Validation

Since we're implementing comprehensive real-world testing of the Phase 1 system, we need to validate every component under authentic conditions with production-scale data and real API integration.

**Environment Setup and Configuration:**
The testing environment requires authentic Synthetic API credentials provided through environment variables (SYNTHETIC_API_KEY), proper SQLite database initialization with the complete schema, and configuration management through the SYNTHETIC_API_CONFIG system. The testing will validate environment detection (development/staging/production), rate limiting configuration, and production-ready error handling.

**Task Hierarchy Real-World Validation:**
We need to create authentic development projects with realistic task hierarchies (projects→roadmaps→macro-tasks→micro-tasks) that mirror actual software development workflows. The testing will validate parent-child relationships, branch name correlation with Git repositories, temporal consistency across task creation and completion, and complex dependency management with realistic development scenarios.

**Semantic Memory Production Testing:**
The testing requires real Synthetic API integration for vector embedding generation, batch processing of realistic code-related content, and similarity search validation with authentic development tasks. We need to test embedding synchronization under concurrent access, memory cleanup with large task hierarchies, and performance benchmarks with production-scale data volumes.

**Memory Bridge Protocol Stress Testing:**
Real-world testing will validate token budget management under burst conditions, context compression effectiveness with realistic development contexts, agent context injection/harvesting cycles with multiple concurrent agents, and cross-session persistence with authentic workflow interruptions and resumptions.

**Production API Integration Validation:**
The testing must validate rate limiting compliance under realistic usage patterns (135 requests per 5-hour window), authentication token refresh cycles, retry logic with actual network conditions, batch optimization effectiveness, and error recovery mechanisms under production stress conditions.

**Performance and Scalability Benchmarks:**
We need to establish baseline performance metrics for task creation (target: <10ms per task), embedding generation (target: <50ms per task), context injection (target: <100ms), and cross-session reconstruction (target: <500ms for complete system). The testing will validate memory usage, database query performance, concurrent access handling, and system stability under sustained load.
