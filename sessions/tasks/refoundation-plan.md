# DevFlow System Refoundation Plan

## Problem/Goal
Execute radical refoundation of DevFlow system to address critical degradations: build system failures, architectural stratifications, and partial integrations that compromise system stability and operability.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] **Emergency Build Fix**: TypeScript compilation 100% success across workspace
- [ ] **CC-Sessions Full Integration**: Complete GWUDCAP/cc-sessions functionality restored
- [ ] **MCP Synthetic Stabilization**: Rate limiting (135/5h) and batch processing operational
- [ ] **CCR Integration**: Claude Code Router proxy with automatic fallback system
- [ ] **Architectural Cleanup**: >50% file reduction, standardized configurations
- [ ] **Production Ready**: Multi-platform CLI integration with unified routing

## Context Manifest

### Critical Issues Identified (2025-09-11)

**Build System BROKEN:**
- TypeScript compilation failure in packages/adapters/claude-code/src/adapter.ts:27
- ContextManager constructor parameter mismatch (expected 2 args, got 1)
- Workspace dependency versioning conflicts between core, adapters, shared packages

**Integration Status:**
- CC-Sessions: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL - basic structure present but incomplete
- MCP Synthetic: OPERATIONAL but unstable - server running with API limits not enforced  
- CCR: INSTALLED but NOT CONFIGURED - package present, setup incomplete

**Architectural Degradation:**
- 5+ overlapping MCP server implementations without cleanup
- 12+ proliferated test files without standardization
- Duplicate configurations: .mcp.json, sessions-config.json, configs/
- Obsolete files and stratifications preventing maintenance

### Stable Version Recovery Point

**Baseline Commit for Recovery:**
- `5b8a3f6`: "feat(orchestration): complete enterprise-grade orchestration system v2.5.0"
- Date: 2025-09-10 12:34:28
- Features: Complete orchestration system, multi-agent architecture, batch processing
- Status: RECOMMENDED as foundation for refoundation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Recovery (2-3 weeks)
1. **Emergency Build Fix** - Immediate TypeScript compilation resolution
2. **CC-Sessions Integration** - Complete GWUDCAP/cc-sessions functionality
3. **Architectural Cleanup** - Remove degraded stratifications  
4. **MCP Synthetic Stabilization** - Rate limiting and batch processing

### Phase 1B: CCR Integration (1-2 weeks)  
1. **CCR Setup** - Claude Code Router proxy configuration
2. **Automatic Fallback** - Seamless handoff to Synthetic during limits
3. **Session Independence** - 99.9% uptime guarantee

### Phase 2: Multi-Platform Integration (3-4 weeks)
1. **OpenAI Codex CLI** - Native integration with context injection
2. **Gemini CLI** - Unified API adaptation layer
3. **Intelligent Routing** - Cost-optimized platform selection

## Context Files
- @docs/sviluppo/piano_rifondazione_1.md: Complete refoundation plan and progress tracking
- @docs/idee_fondanti/piano_strategico_devflow_masterplan_v1.md: Strategic master plan
- @CHANGELOG.md: Granular progress tracking per modifications
- @packages/adapters/claude-code/src/adapter.ts: Critical build failure location

## User Notes
This represents the most critical intervention in DevFlow's development. The system has reached a point where incremental patches are insufficient - radical refoundation is required to establish a stable, maintainable, and extensible foundation.

Key priorities:
- Immediate build system stabilization to enable further development
- Complete integration of cc-sessions for persistent memory management
- MCP Synthetic optimization with proper API rate limiting
- CCR proxy setup for session independence and fallback capabilities

The approach prioritizes stability and reliability over feature additions, with the understanding that a solid foundation is prerequisite to advanced functionality implementation.

## Work Log

### 2025-09-11

#### Analysis and Planning Phase
- **System Diagnosis**: Comprehensive analysis of current codebase degradation
  - Identified TypeScript compilation failures in claude-adapter
  - Documented 5+ overlapping MCP implementations requiring cleanup
  - Catalogued 12+ test files without standardization
  - Assessed integration status: cc-sessions (partial), MCP Synthetic (unstable), CCR (unconfigured)

- **Recovery Planning**: Established 3-phase refoundation strategy
  - Phase 1: Foundation recovery and cc-sessions integration (2-3 weeks)
