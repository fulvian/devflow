# CCR Context Bridge Service CLAUDE.md

## Purpose
Provides intelligent context management and bridging between Claude Code sessions and external AI platforms with fallback orchestration.

## Narrative Summary
The CCR Context Bridge Service manages context flow between Claude Code sessions and external AI platforms through sophisticated session management, context compression, and fallback orchestration. It handles token budget enforcement, cross-session memory persistence, and provides seamless fallback to direct API calls when synthetic platforms are unavailable. The service maintains conversation continuity while optimizing token usage through smart compression and advanced context management.
