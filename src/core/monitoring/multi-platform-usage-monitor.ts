/**
 * DevFlow Dream Team - Multi-Platform Usage Monitor
 *
 * Implements atomic thresholds and usage monitoring for various integrated platforms.
 * This system ensures compliance with usage limits and triggers preventive fallbacks.
 *
 * TASK: Implement multi-platform usage monitor with atomic thresholds
 * - Gemini CLI: 100 req/day, Proâ†’Flash prevention at 60 requests
 * - Qwen CLI: 1000 req/day, conservative fallback at 900
 * - Codex CLI: 150 req/5h, no synthetic fallback
 * - Consensum: 20 req/week for critical decisions
 *
 * INTEGRATION: Must integrate with existing DevFlow agent classification system.
