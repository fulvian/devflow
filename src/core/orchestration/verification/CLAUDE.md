# Testing and Verification Infrastructure CLAUDE.md

## Purpose
Provides comprehensive testing infrastructure and real-world test suites for production readiness validation of the Dream Team Orchestrator.

## Narrative Summary
The Testing and Verification Infrastructure implements comprehensive test suites designed for real-world validation of the Dream Team Orchestrator system. It includes integration tests, end-to-end workflows, smoke tests, and production readiness verification. The infrastructure validates MCP integration, multi-model verification systems, task progress tracking, and overall system reliability under production conditions.
