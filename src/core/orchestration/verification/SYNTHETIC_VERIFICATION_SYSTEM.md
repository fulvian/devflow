# Synthetic Verification System Documentation

## Overview

The Synthetic Verification System replaces legacy mock verification methods with real AI-powered agents that perform comprehensive code verification through synthetic API interactions. This system provides more accurate and reliable verification by simulating real-world usage patterns and edge cases.

## Architecture

### SyntheticVerificationOrchestrator

The `SyntheticVerificationOrchestrator` serves as the central coordination point for all synthetic verification activities. It manages the parallel execution of specialized agents, aggregates results, and handles alert prioritization.
