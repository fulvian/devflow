## Context Manifest

### Project Overview
DevFlow is implementing a comprehensive multi-platform CLI integration to enable seamless interaction with Gemini CLI, Qwen Code CLI, and OpenAI Codex CLI through unified MCP (Model Context Protocol) interfaces. This integration enhances DevFlow's AI agent orchestration capabilities and provides robust fallback mechanisms across multiple AI platforms.

### Technical Context
- **Platform**: DevFlow Core Platform v3.2
- **Integration Target**: Multi-platform CLI integration (Gemini, Qwen, Codex)
- **Architecture**: MCP-based microservices with orchestration layer
- **Authentication**: Multi-provider OAuth + API key management
- **Transport**: MCP stdio + HTTP streaming support

### Current State Analysis
#### Gemini CLI
- ✅ **Existing MCP Server**: `packages/adapters/gemini/src/mcp/gemini-mcp-server.ts`
- ✅ **CLI Wrapper**: `tools/cli/devflow-gemini.mjs` with advanced authentication
- ⚠️ **Issues**: OAuth token management needs improvement
- ✅ **Configuration**: Present in `claude-code-mcp-config.json`

#### Qwen Code CLI
- ❌ **Missing MCP Server**: Only basic wrapper exists
- ⚠️ **Basic CLI Wrapper**: `tools/cli/devflow-qwen.mjs` needs enhancement
- ⚠️ **Limited Configuration**: Basic setup in MCP config
- ❌ **Authentication**: Only environment variable setup

#### OpenAI Codex CLI
- ⚠️ **Partial MCP Server**: Stub implementation in `mcp-servers/codex/src/index.ts`
- ✅ **CLI Wrapper**: `tools/cli/devflow-codex.mjs` present
- ❌ **Rate Limiting Issues**: Currently blocked, needs fallback strategy
- ⚠️ **Authentication**: Basic setup but needs enterprise features

### Dependencies
1. @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.18.1+ (latest MCP SDK)
2. DevFlow Core Services v3.1.0
3. Node.js 20+ with TypeScript support
4. Authentication services for each platform
5. DevFlow database unified migration completion

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All three platforms integrated with robust MCP servers
- ✅ Unified authentication management across platforms
- ✅ Intelligent load balancing and failover mechanisms
- ✅ Performance monitoring and health checks

### Discovered During Implementation
[Date: 2025-09-22 / Session context-refinement]

During implementation of the Unified Orchestrator Architecture v1.0, we discovered critical gaps between apparent functionality and actual execution that weren't documented in the original context. These discoveries fundamentally changed our understanding of the system's operational state.

**Bridge Executor Mock Implementation Issue**: The Bridge Executor (`tools/mcp-bridge-executor.js`) was using hardcoded mock responses instead of calling real MCP Synthetic tools. The `callSyntheticTool()` method contained comments like "Mock implementation for now" and returned static responses rather than executing actual MCP tool calls. This wasn't documented in the original context because the architecture diagrams and specifications assumed real tool integration. The actual behavior meant that while the fallback chain appeared to work (CLI timeout → Synthetic activation), no real tasks were being executed by Synthetic agents.

**Claude Configuration Caching Behavior**: Claude Code caches configuration settings and doesn't automatically reload changes from `.claude/settings.json`. When hook configurations were updated from `orchestration-hook.js` to `unified-orchestrator-hook.js`, the system continued calling the old file until a complete session restart. This wasn't documented in the original context because standard configuration systems typically reload changes automatically. The actual behavior means future implementations need to account for session restarts when making hook configuration changes and potential debugging confusion from cached configurations.

**Unified Orchestrator Integration Gap**: The Architecture v1.0 implementation was structurally complete but had a critical gap in the Bridge Executor layer that prevented real MCP tool execution. The orchestration flow worked correctly (task routing, timeout detection, fallback activation), but the final execution step returned mock data. This wasn't documented in the original context because the architectural specifications focused on the orchestration logic rather than the bridge implementation details. The actual system behavior means the orchestrator can successfully route and manage tasks, but requires a functioning bridge layer to execute real work.

#### Updated Technical Details
- Bridge Executor method `callSyntheticTool()` must call actual MCP tools: `mcp__devflow-synthetic-cc-sessions__synthetic_*`
- Claude Code configuration changes require session restart to take effect
- Hook system debugging complicated by configuration caching
- Fallback chain operational verification requires end-to-end testing with real MCP execution
- Mock detection patterns: Look for comments containing "Mock implementation" or hardcoded return objects

### Task Status: 75% COMPLETE
**Ready for next phase:** Real MCP integration completion, testing, and remaining components (Load Balancer, API Gateway)
