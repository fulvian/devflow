# Task: Context7 Automation Trigger Investigation

**Task ID:** TBD
**Project:** context7-intelligent-automation (ID: TBD)
**Plan:** Context7 Intelligent Trigger System Development Plan (ID: TBD)
**Status:** pending
**Created:** 2025-09-25

## üéØ Objective

Analyze the current DevFlow hook system to identify optimal entry points for automatically triggering Context7 when users encounter coding problems, need documentation, or require best practices guidance. Design an intelligent system that proactively activates Context7 based on contextual signals rather than requiring manual "use context7" commands.

## üîç Current State Analysis

Context7 is currently activated through:
- Manual "use context7" command activation
- Protocol detection in user-prompt-submit-context7.py
- Basic task detection patterns
- DAIC mode switching triggers

The goal is to evolve from reactive manual activation to proactive intelligent triggers based on user behavior patterns and contextual needs.

## Context Manifest

### How Context7 Integration Currently Works

The DevFlow system currently implements Context7 through a sophisticated hook architecture centered around the `.claude/hooks/` directory. When a user interacts with Claude Code, their prompts flow through the `user-prompt-submit-context7.py` hook, which acts as the central intelligence hub for Context7 activation.

The current trigger system operates through several key mechanisms:

**Manual Activation Flow**: When users type "use context7", the system activates through explicit command recognition. This is the primary current method and represents a reactive approach where users must recognize their own need for Context7 assistance.

**Protocol Detection System**: The `user-prompt-submit-context7.py` hook contains sophisticated pattern recognition that detects protocol-related language like "compact", "complete the task", "create a new task". When detected, it injects contextual guidance pointing users to the appropriate protocol files in `sessions/protocols/`. This system recognizes implicit requests for procedural guidance.

**DAIC Mode Integration**: The system manages Discussion/Implementation modes through trigger phrases like "make it so", "run that", "yert". This provides a bridge between discussion and implementation phases, with Context7 providing guidance on when to switch modes and how to maintain proper workflow boundaries.

**Task Detection Intelligence**: Advanced regex patterns identify when users mention potential tasks ("we should implement", "that's a separate task", "we need to handle this later"). When task-worthy content is detected, Context7 provides guidance on whether to create a formal task and how to scope it appropriately.

**Token Usage Monitoring**: The system monitors context window usage through transcript analysis, providing proactive warnings at 75% and 90% capacity. This prevents users from hitting context limits unexpectedly and provides guidance on context compaction protocols.

**Security Filtering**: All Context7 injections pass through security filters that prevent injection of potentially dangerous commands or patterns. This ensures Context7 guidance remains safe even when processing untrusted input.

The current architecture relies on the `standard_hook_pattern.py` base class which provides consistent logging, error handling, and response formatting across all hooks. Context7 responses are injected through the `hookSpecificOutput` field with structured metadata about what processing occurred.

### What Needs Enhancement: Intelligent Proactive Triggers

The current system is primarily reactive - it responds to explicit user requests or obvious keywords. The enhancement opportunity lies in developing predictive intelligence that can recognize contextual situations where Context7 would be valuable before users explicitly request it.

**Error Pattern Recognition**: When users encounter compilation errors, runtime exceptions, or failed tool executions, the system should automatically provide Context7 guidance on debugging approaches, common solutions, and best practices for the specific error type. The `post-tool-use.py` hook currently handles tool completion but could be enhanced to analyze tool failures and provide contextual assistance.

**Documentation Need Detection**: When users ask questions about unfamiliar APIs, request explanations of code patterns, or show confusion about architectural decisions, Context7 should proactively offer relevant documentation, examples, and best practices. This requires analyzing user language patterns for uncertainty indicators and knowledge gaps.

**Code Quality Opportunities**: When users write code that violates established patterns, misses security considerations, or deviates from project conventions, Context7 should provide gentle guidance toward better approaches. This requires integration with code analysis tools and project-specific style guides.

**Workflow State Detection**: When users appear stuck, are repeating similar actions, or are working outside established workflows, Context7 should offer process guidance and suggest more efficient approaches. This requires analyzing action patterns and detecting inefficiency signals.

**Learning Moment Recognition**: When users discover new techniques, solve complex problems, or make architectural decisions, Context7 should suggest documenting these insights for team knowledge sharing and future reference.

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Hook System Integration**: New trigger logic must integrate with the existing hook architecture, respecting the `standard_hook_pattern.py` base class and Context7 compliance requirements. Triggers should be implemented as enhancements to existing hooks rather than separate systems to maintain architectural coherence.

**Real-time Analysis Engine**: The system needs capability to analyze user actions, tool outputs, and conversation context in real-time to identify trigger conditions. This requires efficient pattern matching and state tracking without impacting session performance.

**Contextual State Management**: The system must maintain awareness of current task context, user skill level, recent actions, and session history to make intelligent trigger decisions. This requires enhancement to the existing state management in `.claude/state/` directory.

**Machine Learning Integration**: Advanced trigger intelligence may require ML models trained on successful Context7 interactions to predict when activation would be valuable. This requires infrastructure for model integration and inference within the hook system.

**Performance Monitoring**: New triggers must not degrade session performance or increase token usage significantly. This requires careful optimization and monitoring of computational overhead.

**User Preference Learning**: The system should learn from user responses to Context7 suggestions to improve trigger accuracy and reduce false positives. This requires feedback collection and preference adaptation mechanisms.
