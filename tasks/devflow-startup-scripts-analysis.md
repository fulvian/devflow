# DevFlow Startup Scripts Analysis and Migration Assessment

## Objective

Compare the current `start-devflow.sh` (aligned with current architecture) with the legacy `devflow-start.sh` to identify:
1. Services that have been replaced/migrated
2. Services present in legacy but missing in current version
3. Assessment of missing services for potential integration, obsolescence, or architectural conflicts

## Context

DevFlow has undergone significant architectural evolution. The current `start-devflow.sh` represents the Unified System v1.0 architecture, while `devflow-start.sh` represents the v3.1.0 Cometa Production System. We need to ensure no valuable services are lost during the transition while avoiding architectural complexity.

## Scope

- **IN SCOPE**: Service functionality analysis, architectural alignment assessment, migration recommendations
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: Code modifications at this stage (analysis only)

## Deliverables

1. Current architecture service inventory
2. Legacy architecture service inventory
3. Service comparison matrix
4. Gap analysis report
5. Recommendations for each missing service (integrate/obsolete/refactor)

## Success Criteria

- Complete service mapping between both architectures
- Clear recommendations for each legacy service
- Architectural impact assessment
- Implementation priority matrix

## Research Sources

- Current codebase structure
- Context7 documentation
- Online DevFlow best practices
- System architecture documentation

## Timeline

- Analysis Phase: Immediate
- Research Phase: 1-2 hours
- Report Generation: 2-3 hours
- Review and Recommendations: 1 hour

## Notes

This analysis will inform the next phase of DevFlow architecture consolidation and ensure we maintain all valuable functionality while simplifying the overall system.
